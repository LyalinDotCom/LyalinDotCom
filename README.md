## üëã Hey there!

25+ years building stuff. Currently at Google as Group PM for Firebase - working on serverless products (Cloud Functions, Hosting, Storage) and our new AI framework, Genkit. Basically helping developers ship apps faster.

Before Google: 14 years at Microsoft. Started as a dev consultant, ended up as Principal PM. Built Hot Reload for .NET/C++ (you're welcome!), shipped .NET MAUI 1.0, made XAML tools suck less, and helped rebrand VSTS to Azure DevOps. Also keynoted at .NET Conf and ran Build.

Started my career bouncing between banks, startups, and everything in between. Real-world experience that taught me developers just want tools that work. 

Beyond tech: 6.5 years as NYPD Auxiliary Police in NYC, now doing C.E.R.T. with Florida fire department. Community matters.

## ü§ñ AI Coding Adventures

I'm all-in on AI coding tools - Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, Firebase Studio. Want to see what they can really do? I built games (never done that before):

- [**Defend Ship**](https://dronedefense.web.app/) - Tower defense with boats. Has weather effects!
- [**Maze Explorer**](https://mazeexplorer-e2b48.web.app/) - Touch-friendly maze game
- [**Space City**](https://spacecity-350f9.web.app/) - Build colonies in space
- [**Solar Explorer**](https://solarexplorer.web.app/) - Solar system sim with debug tools

Zero game dev experience ‚Üí playable prototypes in days. Pretty impressive what AI pair programming can do.

## üõ†Ô∏è Open Source Projects

Building tools and examples that help developers:

- [**learn-genkit-gemini**](https://github.com/LyalinDotCom/learn-genkit-gemini) - Comprehensive examples for Google's Genkit with Gemini AI. Text, speech, images, video - all the AI generation patterns in one place. Planning to contribute automated sample generation back to Genkit.

- [**Genkit-Ollama-VisionSample**](https://github.com/LyalinDotCom/Genkit-Ollama-VisionSample) - Text extraction from images using local open-source models. Built this for myself ("just in time software") when I needed privacy-focused OCR. Drag-drop, paste, or URL - it just works.

- [**ConfigureMacKeys**](https://github.com/LyalinDotCom/ConfigureMacKeys) - CLI tool for managing Mac environment variables safely. Got tired of manually editing .zshrc, so I built this. Auto-backups before changes because we've all been there.
