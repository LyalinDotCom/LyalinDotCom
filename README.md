25+ years building stuff. Currently at Google as Group PM for Firebase - working on serverless products (Cloud Functions, Hosting, Storage, Extensions, App Hosting, Firebase ML) and our new AI framework, Genkit. Basically helping developers ship apps faster.

Led multiple products from zero to GA:
- **[Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.blog/posts/2024/05/introducing-app-hosting/)** - Simplified serverless hosting for Next.js/Angular apps. No more config hell - just GitHub integration and automatic scaling.
- **[Firebase Genkit](https://firebase.blog/posts/2024/05/introducing-genkit/)** - Open-source AI framework for JS/TS developers. Making AI development as easy as Firebase made mobile backends.

Before Google: 14 years at Microsoft. Started as a dev consultant, ended up as Principal PM. Built Hot Reload for .NET/C++ (you're welcome!), shipped .NET MAUI 1.0, made XAML tools suck less, and helped rebrand VSTS to Azure DevOps. Also keynoted at .NET Conf and ran Build.

Started my career bouncing between banks, startups, and everything in between. Real-world experience that taught me developers just want tools that work. 

Beyond tech: 6.5 years as NYPD Auxiliary Police in NYC, now doing C.E.R.T. with Florida fire department. Community matters.

## ü§ñ AI Coding Adventures

I'm all-in on AI coding tools - Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, Firebase Studio. Want to see what they can really do? I built games (never done that before):

- [**Defend Ship**](https://dronedefense.web.app/) - Tower defense with boats. Has weather effects!
- [**Maze Explorer**](https://mazeexplorer-e2b48.web.app/) - Touch-friendly maze game
- [**Space City**](https://spacecity-350f9.web.app/) - Build colonies in space
- [**Solar Explorer**](https://solarexplorer.web.app/) - Solar system sim with debug tools

Zero game dev experience ‚Üí playable prototypes in days. Pretty impressive what AI pair programming can do.

I also use AI to prototype product concepts:
- [**AI-Centric Firebase Hosting Onboarding**](https://hostingdoc-preview.web.app/) - Experimental UI showing how AI could transform developer onboarding. Features Gemini CLI integration for AI-assisted deployment. Not official - just me exploring what's possible.
- [**Voice-Powered Firebase Studio Feedback**](https://screen.studio/share/YmBw2pjG) (video) - Built a Chrome extension + Node.js server to prototype voice feedback for code changes. Instead of just writing a PRD, I made it real. The AI summarizes changes instead of reading walls of text - way more tangible than any spec document.

## üõ†Ô∏è Open Source Projects

Building tools and examples that help developers (all created with AI assistance):

- [**learn-genkit-gemini**](https://github.com/LyalinDotCom/learn-genkit-gemini) - Experiments using Gemini CLI to automate sample generation for Google's Genkit framework. Planning to contribute this automation back to the Genkit project.

- [**TextToSpeechGenkitDemo**](https://github.com/LyalinDotCom/TextToSpeechGenkitDemo) - Text-to-speech demo using Genkit and Gemini models. Single and multi-speaker audio generation that actually sounds good. Next.js + AI voice synthesis made simple.

- [**Genkit-Ollama-VisionSample**](https://github.com/LyalinDotCom/Genkit-Ollama-VisionSample) - Text extraction from images using local open-source models. Filling a documentation gap and proving this pattern works for future docs. Drag-drop, paste, or URL - it just works.

- [**ConfigureMacKeys**](https://github.com/LyalinDotCom/ConfigureMacKeys) - CLI tool for managing Mac environment variables safely. Built this for myself ("just in time software") - got tired of googling how to set env vars every time. Auto-backups before changes because we've all been there.
